This site will host a number of the courses I have attended in the past few years at various universities around the world.  Most have significant amounts of video lectures contained in the course resources.  The subjects include:

- Computer Science
- Computer Languages and Programming
- Data Science
- Statistics
- Bioinformatics
- Molecular Biology (Virology)
- Genetics
- Epidemiology
- Public Health
- Forensic Science

All courses are meant to be self-paced at this point in time.

Have fun.
